# Flights_Delays_Data_Visualization_Project
The goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns in the Flights Delays data set. The  project was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.
