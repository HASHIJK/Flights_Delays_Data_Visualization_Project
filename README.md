**Project Description** <br/>
The goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns in the Flights Delays data set. The  project was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. I quoted a text from the Udacity to describe this project clearly, (_In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging, and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative_). <br/>
<br/>

**Getting Dataset** <br/> 
In this project, you have different three datasets, you can choose any one of them, I chose The Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset, you can find out this data in _Kaggle_. The remaining datasets are: _2. US Census Demographic Data_ 3. _Youtube Data US_. All of this dataset is in _Kaggle_. You can download the cleaned dataset which I used in the visualization phase of this project, by pressing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZ0zhm_qPRkf2UNx6bnuPURAPuXF78Ba/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113179356126063295861&rtpof=true&sd=true). <br/> 
<br/>

**Project Requirements** <br/>
This project was challenging, because you have raw data, and you have to work through the Data Analytics Workflow from A to Z. In other words, from understanding the data to visualize it. So, the requirements of this project are: <br/>

1. Preparing the data, all the columns associated with time in the dataset are represented as the total minutes, for example (1770m). So, this format isn't clear for analyzing and visualizing process. Therefore I needed to change the format of these columns. <br/>
2. Creating Visuals (at least 4 visuals). 
3. Creating complete and professional dashboards (at least 1 dashboard). <br/>
4. Make a story that tells the final story of the project (at least 1 story). <br/>
5. Writing a final report. <br/>

**Project Methodology** <br/> 
At First, I prepared the data in excel to make me achieve the goals from analyzing and sharing insight with visuals. The key point I did it, is convert the decimal numbers of columns’ times to be in [hh: mm] context. After that I load all the sheets in Tableau to tie them together. I used an inner join to do it, as shown below: <br/>

Then, I use them to spot the facts and associations. One important thing that was helping me, is creating a calculated field called Number of Cancelled Field to determine the transactions has 1 ‘cancelled’ as a value. After that I visualize my data points and make dashboards and story. <br/>
<br/>

**Used Tools in this Project** <br/>
I used just these tools: <br/>
1. Excel.<br/>
2. Tableau Puplic. <br/>

**Project Outcomes or Findings** <br/>
Early, you can’t understand what findings that the data is provided to you, after segmenting the data to parts and linking them together you will see a whole picture. So, I counted the number of cancelled flights associated with different aspects of data, like (cities, airports, airlines, month, day of week). And I gained the following insights: <br/>
1.	The cancelled flights decreases on Wednesday than other days. <br/>
2.	The cancelled flights increase more in February causes to the Weather Cancellation reasons.  <br/>
3.	Most cancellation reasons are occurring causing to the Weather reasons than remaining reasons.  <br/>
4.	One of the key reasons to cancel flights is the Weather cases. <br/>
5.	There is an Expected relationship between Departure and Arrival Delays with the number of Cancelled Flights. <br/>
