**Project Description** <br/>
The goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns in the Flights Delays data set. The  project was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. I quoted a text from the Udacity to describe this project clearly, (_In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging, and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative_). <br/>
<br/>

**Getting Dataset** <br/> 
In this project, you have different three datasets, you can choose any one of them, I chose The Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset, you can find out this data in _Kaggle_. The remaining datasets are: _2. US Census Demographic Data_ 3. _Youtube Data US_. All of this dataset is in _Kaggle_. You can download the cleaned dataset which I used in the visualization phase of this project, by pressing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZ0zhm_qPRkf2UNx6bnuPURAPuXF78Ba/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113179356126063295861&rtpof=true&sd=true). <br/> 
<br/>

**Project Requirements** <br/>
This project was challenging, because you have raw data, and you have to work through the Data Analytics Workflow from A to Z. In other words, from understanding the data to visualize it. So, the requirements of this project are: <br/>
1. Creating Visuals (I build 7 visuals of 7 questions). 
2. Creating complete and professional dashboards. (I build 2 dashboards). <br/>
3. Make a story that tells the final story of the project. (Storytelling) <br/>.
4. Write a final report. <br/>
