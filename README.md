**Project Description** <br/>
The goal in this project is to create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. I created data visualizations that tell a story and highlight patterns in the Flights Delays data set. The  project was a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication. I quoted a text from the Udacity to describe this project clearly, (_In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to combine a lot of what you’ve learned throughout this entire program. This project may seem challenging, and there isn’t a lot of guidance provided, as we want you to have the freedom to be creative_). <br/>
<br/>

**Getting Dataset** <br/> 
In this project, you have different three datasets, you can choose any one of them, I chose The Flight Delays and Cancellations Dataset, you can find out this data in _Kaggle_. The remaining datasets are: _2. US Census Demographic Data_ 3. _Youtube Data US_. All of this dataset is in _Kaggle_. You can download the cleaned dataset which I used in the visualization phase of this project, by pressing [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jZ0zhm_qPRkf2UNx6bnuPURAPuXF78Ba/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113179356126063295861&rtpof=true&sd=true). <br/>

**Project Requirements** <br/>
This project was challenging, because you have raw data, and you have to work through the Data Analytics Workflow from A to Z. In other words, from understanding the data to visualize it. So, the requirements of this project are: <br/>

1. Preparing the data, all the columns associated with time in the Dataset are represented as the total minutes, for example (1770m). So, that form isn't clear for analyzing and visualizing process. Therefore I needed to change the format of these columns. <br/>
2. Creating Visuals (I build 7 visuals of 7 questions). 
3. Creating complete and professional dashboards. (I build 2 dashboards). <br/>
4. Make a story that tells the final story of the project. (Storytelling) <br/>.
5. Write a final report. <br/>
